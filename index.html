            <p >The â€œvoice of hope" project aims to provide a platform for Afghan girls who are deprived from going to school . This online education initiative will offer online classes in school subjects, focusing on both academic and personal development, to help Afghan girls gain knowledge, confidence, and skills for their future. By leveraging technology and the internet, the project seeks to break down barriers to education and foster a sense of empowerment among Afghan females.
